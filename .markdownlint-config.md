# Markdownlint Configuration

This file configures markdown linting rules for the project.

## Disabled Rules

- **MD012** (no-multiple-blanks): Disabled - multiple blank lines are acceptable for readability
- **MD026** (no-trailing-punctuation): Disabled - punctuation in headings is sometimes necessary
- **MD032** (blanks-around-lists): Disabled - strict list spacing can be too aggressive with nested content
- **MD034** (no-bare-urls): Disabled - bare URLs are acceptable in documentation
- **MD041** (first-line-heading): Disabled - not all files need to start with heading

## Relaxed Rules

- **MD013** (line-length): Increased to 150 characters for better readability
  - Excludes code blocks, tables, and headings
- **MD022** (blanks-around-headings): Set to require 1 line above and below

## Standard Rules

All other rules follow markdownlint defaults for consistency and quality.

## Testing

Run local checks with:

```bash
# If markdownlint-cli2 is installed
markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"

# Or use custom checker
python3 scripts/check-markdown.py
```
